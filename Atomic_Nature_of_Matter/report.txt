1. Hours to complete the project: ~25 hours

2. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Particle Identification): 
First of all it was very hard to understand where to start the problem. I was
really confused between bolbs and beads. In the first problem we had to 
identify the beads which are just blob objects with the mass more than the tau
value. First we had to implement a class Blolb which includes a constructor,
add method that adds the pixels passed to the blob object, mass funtion that
returns mass, and distance function. It was very confusing to update the center
of mass.We had to update the center of mass by taking the average of the pixels
and then adding the pixels which increases the mass aswell and updates the 
coordinates as well. We calculated the euclidean distance using
the formula ((x1-x2)^2+(y1-y2)^2)^0.5.

Then in the blob finder, at first we take in the values of P, tau, jpic as 
command line arguments and stored the value of jpic as a Picture object.

   Problem 2 (Particle Tracking):

4. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   Due to less time I had to skip the report . Sorry
